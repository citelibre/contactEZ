This repository hosts all source code required to launch a full-featured local CiteLibre ContactEZ application.

CiteLibre Contact'EZ is a Service'EZ implementation that lets you easily set up contact forms for your users: spontaneous contact, questions to user or technical services... benefit from ready-to-use forms, develop them according to your needs, and freely create new ones.
